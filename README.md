### MVP Objectives:

- Build a store front website that allows a user to create and account and log -in in a safely manner.
- Once inside their accounts a user can choose a hat from the different options, maybe 5 types of hats. After choosing a hat the user will be able to add different features to the hat such as : colors, items,etc.

- The user will be able to customize a hat and save it in their cart

- Upload photos of the users custom hats to each account

- I will use Next.js as my framework for React. For the database I'm looking into supabase and for styling, my library of choice will be MUI. I will use Typescript ofr the whole project.

### Stretch Goals:

- Connect the store with a third party client for payment processing

For this code Review I will be researching on how to use next.js, typescript and MUI.
